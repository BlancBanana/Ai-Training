Project Trinity: Phase 1 – Core Architecture & Feature Extraction
Project Trinity is an evolving algorithmic trading system designed to leverage Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for market analysis.

Currently in Phase 1, this repository focuses on the foundational Feature Extractor (Encoder) and the custom Gym Environment. 
These components are critical for processing complex financial time-series data and preparing the state space for future reinforcement learning agents.

Phase 1 Highlights
Hybrid Encoder Architecture: Engineered a robust feature extractor using Python and PyTorch. This module combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to capture local patterns 
with Transformers to understand long-term market dependencies.

Development Methodology: "Vibe Code" Approach
This project utilizes a Vibe Code methodology to accelerate the development of complex architectures:

AI-Assisted Prototyping: A significant portion of the Phase 1 structural logic was synthesized using AI-driven coding assistants. This allowed for rapid iteration of the Encoder's 
dimensionality and the Gym environment's reward structures.

Logic-First Engineering: By leveraging Vibe Coding, focus was shifted from boilerplate syntax to high-level architectural design and mathematical correctness of the feature extraction layers.
